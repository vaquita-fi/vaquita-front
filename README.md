# 🐮 Vaquita: First gamify Save-to-Earn DeFi platform

Vaquita is a decentralized savings platform designed to build long-term savings habits through gamification and smart incentives. Built on **Base**, Vaquita turns saving into an engaging experience where commitment is rewarded and early withdrawals are penalized — ensuring better returns for disciplined savers.

## 🌎 Problem We're Solving

> **60% of people in LATAM don't save.**  
There’s a lack of culture, tools, and incentives to encourage long-term saving habits.

Vaquita addresses this by making saving fun, social, and financially rewarding.

## 🕹️ How Vaquita Works

- **Dynamic Reward Pool:**  
  Users who stay committed to their savings goals earn not only interest but also a share of penalties from those who withdraw early.

- **Game Theory Incentives:**  
  Rewards are redistributed to long-term savers, encouraging consistency and reducing the temptation of early withdrawals.

- **Gamified Experience:**  
  Users interact with visual elements (like cow avatars representing savings goals) and track their progress in a fun, engaging way.
